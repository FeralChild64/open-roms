Branch over two instructions, first being LDA #$xx

This corresponds to the following sequence:

Bxx +
LDA #$xx
(two more bytes not matched
*

This is the obvious way to conditionally execute two instructions,
the first of which is LDA #$xx, which is very common.

That the argument of LDA #$xx doesn't match, nor does the following
two bytes, adds strength to the argument that this is a non-copyrightable
sequence of bytes.
