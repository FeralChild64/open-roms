List of key codes generated when certain key combinations are pressed

This sequence is a list of which ASCII/PETSCII code should be generated
when certain key combinations are pressed, based on the keyboard matrix
position.  That is, it is a sequence in keyboard matrix order, of the
codes that should be generated. Thus it is a list of facts, which cannot
be copyright, according to the long standing precedent under US copyright law:

Similar decisions exist in other jurisidctions.

Note also that the matrix order list of keys is a fact of the C64 hardware,
and which has been repeated in many publications, such as Compute's Mapping the 64,
without challenge from the C64 ROM copyright owners, which serves to reinforce the
claim that this sequence of bytes is not copyrightable.
