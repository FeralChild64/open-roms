PLA / TAY / PLA / TAX sequence / followed by LDA $nn

This is a common sequence for restoring registers from the stack.
It is a fragment of the reverse of pushing the registers A X and Y
in alphabetic order.
The frequency of LDA $nn instructions also makes this complete sequence
no more remarkable.
 Not copyrightable.
