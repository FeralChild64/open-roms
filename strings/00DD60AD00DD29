Do something with $DD00, return from subroutine. Do something else with $DD00

$DD00 is an IO register of a CIA in the C64 associated with the disk drive port.
Thus having routines that do things with it is expected and necessary.
The sequence here has nothing creative nor is it in our view copyrightable.
