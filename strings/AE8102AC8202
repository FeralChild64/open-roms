Load X and Y from pointer at $0281

LDX $0281
LDY $0282

Loading two registers from two successive memory locations
is not copyrightable.

On the C64, these locations typically hold the start of memory
pointer, thus even if the sequence were somehow copyrightable,
which we do not admit, it is an obvious and expected sequence
whenever one wishes to load the start of memory pointer into 
registers to be worked with.  Thus it must be held to be both
fair use and exempt under interoperability provisions in various
copyright acts, if the defence were required.
