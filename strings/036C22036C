$03 (most likely adddress higher byte) + JMP ($0322) (via public, documented vector) + JMP (address does not match)

Code similarity due to Kernal API usage convention. Since 6510 CPU does not have indirect JSR, the only sane possibility to use Kernal API vectors in RAM ($0314-$0333) is to have JMP ($address) hardcoded somewhere. The jump table has intentionally strange order (to avoid code similarity as much as possible), but some small similarities can't be avoided in any reasonable way.
