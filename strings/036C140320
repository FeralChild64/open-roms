Jump to routine at vector $0314

This corresponds to

Bxx +
JMP ($0314)
*
JSR $xxxx

That is, based on the result of some branch instruction, 
optionally jump to the routine whose address is stored in
$0314 - $0315.
The use of a jump table is not copyrightable of itself.
The location of jump table vectors at $0314 on the C64 is publicly
documented.  
There are also unrelated systems using jumptables with the constant
$0314, e.g.:
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/mosaic.cpp
http://www.microchip.com/forums/download.axd?file=1;895201

In short, there is absolutely no reason to be able to even entertain
copyrighting jumping through a vector at $0314.
