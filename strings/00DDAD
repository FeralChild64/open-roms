Do something with $DD00, then read something from memory. Only instruction fragments.

No whole instructions here.
$DD00 is a CIA IO register on the C64, so doing things with it is rather necessary.
Loading from memory is also intrinsic to operation of a processor.
Nothing creative. Nothing copyrightable.
