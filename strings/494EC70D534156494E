PETSCII string: IN(G + end of string mark) + <CR> + SAVIN

Encoding strings by adding $80 to it's last character (to mark end of stream) is a common byte-saving technique - for example, Turbo Basic XL (for Atari, now open-source) does the same.
Here we don't even have a single word - not copyrightable.
