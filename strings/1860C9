CLC / RTS / CMP #$xx

Clear carry flag when exiting a routine (very common constrution).
What happens to be after the RTS is from another routine, and it is 
mere coincidence that it makes such a thing.
Of course, as there are many routines that end with CLC, it is quite
likely that such matches will happen by pure chance.
Nothing creative or copyrightable.
