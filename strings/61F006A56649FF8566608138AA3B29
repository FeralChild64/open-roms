$61 + BEQ (offset matches) + LDA $66 + EOR #$FF + STA $66 + RTS + floating point constant 1.0 / log_e(2.0) (last byte differs, probablyy due to rounding)

A part of trivial routine, reversing the sign of floating point accumulator, if it is not 0. Afterwards a floating point constant - a fact (generated by a specially written tool), not creative work.
Locations of the routine/constant are not creative work either - we have to preserve them to keep the compatiibility.

Not copyrightable.
