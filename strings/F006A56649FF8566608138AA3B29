BEQ (offset matches) + LDA $66 + EOR #$FF + STA $66 + RTS + floating point constant 1.0 / log_e(2.0)

Most of a trivial routine to toggle floating point variable sign + floating point constant (generated by a special tool). The addresses has to remain as they are for compatibility. Not creative - not copyrightable.
