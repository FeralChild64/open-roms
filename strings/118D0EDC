Do something with $11, then write to $DC0E

This is probably the tail end of something like:

LDA #$11
STA $DC0E

Putting a value into a memory location is not copyrightable.

$DC0E is one of the control registers for a 6526 CIA on
the Commodore 64, and thus writing to it is totally normal
and expected.
