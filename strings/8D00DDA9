Store something in $DD00, then load something into the A register

STA $DD00
LDA #$xx

Writing to a memory location is not copyrightable.
Loading something into the A register happens very frequently.
Thus the only non-random thing about this pair of instructions
is that the C64 has an important IO register at $DD00, which
makes it much more likely that such a sequence will occur as
a random part of writing programs.  It is in any case not
copyrightable.
