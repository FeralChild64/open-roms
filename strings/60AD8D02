RTS + LDA $028D

RTS is a very common instruction, as is loading A from absolute address.
The RTS is the end of a routine, and the LDA $028D thus the start of
another. Thus this would occur whenever a routine begins with loading
A from $028D, immediately after another routine.  Nothing creative.
Not copyrightable.
