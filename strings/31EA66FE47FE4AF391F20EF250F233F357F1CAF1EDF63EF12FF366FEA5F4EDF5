a list of vectors to be copied starting from $0314

Values of the vectors are already present in many autostart software - as it often overrides them,
sometimes changing one to trigger autostart (one of the possible techniques). We have to use the same
vector values to be compatible (in fact, it even complicates our implementation) - see *.interop files
for more details.
