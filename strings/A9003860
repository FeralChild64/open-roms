LDA #$00 / SEC / RTS - Return failure and 0 from a KERNAL routine

The C64 KERNAL public API indicates that the carry flag should be set
to report failure of many routines, and those routines can also return
A=$00 as part of that.  
Also, returning such values from a routine is not uncommon generally,
and lacks all creativity. Not copyrightable.
