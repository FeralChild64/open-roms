instruction fragment followed by JSR to VIC-II register setup.

$E5A0 is documented in Compute's Mapping the 64 on p216 as
the correct location for this routine, so it is no surprise to
find a call there.
Not creative. Not copyrightable.

The leading $EA which is a NOP in the C64 KERNAL is a good example
of purely cooincidental matches, as in our ROM it is the high-byte
of an argument to the preceeding instruction.
