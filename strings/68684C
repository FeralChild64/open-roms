PLA / PLA / JMP

Pulling two values off the stack is a common way to simulate returning
from a routine, i.e., to remove the return address from the stack.
That such a sequence is followed by a JMP is not at all surprising,
given this.  But at the end of the day, pulling things off the stack
and jumping somewhere without a matching destination cannot possibly
be copyrightable
