String "BASIC V2"

As we are implementing a V2 class BASIC interprettor, it is 
natural for us to include this string.
There are many BASIC intreprettors, and the word cannot be
copyrighted, nor it is reasonable to contemplate that a party
could be constrained from having a BASIC with version 2, or
displaying that information anywhere. Not copyrightable.
