	// DATA now has the next bit, but inverted (well, except that it turns out not to be).
	// DATA is in bit 7, which is a bit annoying.
	// But we can clock it out with a ROL instruction
	// so that it is in C. We can then ROR it into the
	// partial data byte.
	// We use ROR so that we shift in from the top, so that
	// the first bit we shift in ends up in bit 0 after all
	// 8 bits have been read.
	// ODD: For some reason we don't need to invert the
	// received bits.  This is weird, because we invert them
	// on the way out, and everything in the protocol seems
	// to indicate that we sould do so.  But experimentation
	// has confirmed the bits don't need inversion on reception.
