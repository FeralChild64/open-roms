All the BASIC routines, for which there are vectors in $0300-$030B, have to be available at their original addresses.

Reason: some autostart software (https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:autostarting_disk_files) override these vectors, so that some point
to new locations (usually Kernal related), while others points the original BASIC routines. Different techniques modify different vectors
(while resetting others to original C64 locations), some don't change the vectors at all, but might still put the original
C64 BASIC addresses there.

For various cartridges this just means disabling their extensions (like new commands); for us that would mean improperly functionning BASIC.
