Follow these rules, or bad things will happen!


- Don't mix ROMs for different platforms - use generic BASIC with generic KERNAL, Ultimate64 BASIC with Ultimate64 KERNAL, etc.

- Don't mix these ROMs with any other ROMs; exceptions:

   - kernal_hybrid.rom, which is meant to be used (and has to be used) with the original BASIC ROM;
     however, this hybrid ROM cannot be distributed due to legal/copyright reasons

   - chargen_*.rom - these ones are fully interchangeable

- Don't mix ROMs from different builds/versions (again, CHARGEN is an exception).

- The generic ROM set should be compatible with any C64-compatible machine; platform-specific ROMs might not work on other platforms.


Have fun!
