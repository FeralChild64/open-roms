Follow these rules, or bad things will happen!

* Don't mix ROMs for different platforms - use generic BASIC with generic KERNAL, Ultimate64 BASIC with Ultimate64 KERNAL, etc.

* Don't mix these ROMs with any other ROMs; exceptions:

   - kernal_hybrid\*.rom, which is meant to be used (and has to be used) with the original BASIC ROM;
     however, these hybrid ROMs cannot be distributed due to legal/copyright reasons; see [here](./../doc/Hybrid-build.md) for instruction how to create them

   - chargen_*.rom - these ones are fully interchangeable

* Don't mix ROMs from different builds/versions (again, CHARGEN is an exception).

* The generic ROM set should be compatible with any C64-compatible machine; platform-specific ROMs might not work on other platforms.
 
<br />

For Ultimate 64 motherboard the following settings are recommended:

* U64 Specific Settings -> Turbo Control -> U64 Turbo Registers

<br />

The \*\_crt ROM set is a special version, with some code moved to external ROM on the cartridge - thus, more features could be enabled. It needs all the 3 files (BASIC, Kernal, cartridge) to be operable.

<br />

Have fun!
