	// According to [CM64], page 27, the action we have to perform is to copy
	// the last row of keyboard to RAM, so that various routines can detect the STOP
	// key press. But something as simple as this would have created warm restart
	// with M+N+SPACE+RESTORE due to ghosting - so the original ROM has to provide
	// some protection here. I do not know what the mechanism there exactly does,
	// but I hope the mechanism below will be compatible enough.

	// the keyboard at this point, but certain software (mainly intros) is
	// unable to, for example, read the space bar status.
