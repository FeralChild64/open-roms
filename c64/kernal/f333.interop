All the Kernal routines, for which there are vectors in $0314-$0333, have to be available at their original addresses.

Reason: some autostart software (https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:autostarting_disk_files) override these vectors, so that some point
to new locations (custom IRQ routine, custom STOP routine, etc.), while others points the original Kernal routines. Different techniques modify
different vectors (while resetting others to original C64 locations), some don't change the vectors at all, but might still put the original
C64 Kernal addresses there (for example, if the file overrides keyboard input buffer and screeen memory).

For various cartridges (like IDE64) this just means disabling their extensions; for us that would mean improperly functionning Kernal.
