Program traces are generated by running VICE's C64 emuluator (x64) with
the collect_data program, to generate the list of KERNAL calls that a
program makes.  This is used to generate the set of entry points that
are required in order to provide interoperability with the original
C64 KERNAL.

To collect a program trace:

x64 -remotemonitor &
src/collect_data localhost 6510 | tee logfile
